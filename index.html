                    <p>
                        Hi, I trained in Economics and now professionally transitioning to the field of data science! I consider this transition to be an effort to broaden and deepen my core strengths as a researcher/analyst. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>
                        
                        I like looking at data analysis and quantitative modelling as tools to answer interesting analytical questions.                               
                        I spent last 8 years doing research across policy issues at think tanks and building statistical models to analyse financial markets.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p >
                        Between 2015-2021 I worked in finance building models of fair value, macroeconomic connectedness, financial conditions, 
                        analysed fixed income in emerging markets, central bank policies, government budgets and built models for periodic market assessments. Before I worked in finance, I spent two interesting years working at two think tanks where I
                        looked into models of international flows, policy issues like debt restructuring and financial inclusion in India. I have also spent brief but unforgettable periods during my student internship days doing primary research in rural India on access to banking.                        
                        Before I started my professional journey, I did my masterâ€™s specialising in Econometrics and undergraduate in Economics, Sociology and Political Science. After my first professional stint I even spent an unimaginable year at Oxford!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> 
                        When I am not learning something new in programming or statistics I find myself exploring the city with my family or enjoying some serious pretend play with my daughter. 
                        I enjoy discovering books, movies, and music; I really like food, cooking and traveling. And I am always looking for inspiration in the beautiful work of creative people around the world!
                    </p>
